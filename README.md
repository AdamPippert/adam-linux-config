# adam-linux-config

This is a very basic Ansible playbook for setting up my Fedora workstation in my office.  Feel free to use this an modify it to your liking.

Today, it uses a set of variable files in the "files" directory to define DNF packages and basic install scripts.  I will build out some package lists for pip and cargo to install as well, much like I did for the AdamPippert/adam-mac-config project.

I hope this is useful for at least someone that wants to just get some basic package management and configuration quickly without too much fuss.
